<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>Programming & Scripting</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>xinu</dt>
		<dd>XINU is an operating system that runs on many platforms.  I learned the PPC version in Operating Systems, and Summer 2007 I am developing it on the MIPS platform.  See the <a href="http://mulug.mscs.mu.edu/wrt-wiki/">Embedded XINU project wiki</a> for more information.</dd>
	<dt>unix tools</dt>
		<dd>I use a lot of unix tools in managing my computers and my life.  I would eventually like to maintain a few notes somewhere on the web (be it on this site or elsewhere) about my own personal config files, tips, etc.</dd>

<h2>Web Development</h2>
<dl>
	<dt><a href="http://www.kelleysmurals.com">kellysmurals.com</a></dt>
		<dd>Kelley paints custom murals as a summer job, and she wanted a website to present some basic information as well as showcase some of her work to potential clients.</dd>
	<dt><a href="http://marquetteradio.mu.edu">marquetteradio.mu.edu</a></dt>
		<dd>One of the sites that I reworked in my first year at Student Media Interactive.  Worked around the fact that the IT department would not allow us access to a web database by hacking up a text-based database in PHP.  It wasn't pretty behind the scenes, but it greatly improved the presentation of the radio show schedule.</dd>
	<dt><a href="http://nationaltryst.com">nationaltryst.com</a></dt>
		<dd>A small site for this Chicago-based folk-pop band.  They've got some pretty good music and you can listen to some of it on the site.</dd>
	<dt>rubberband</dt>
		<dd>A long time ago, faced with the task of creating websites for three different local bands, my brother and I decided to write a content management system before we knew what those words meant.  It was a DRY nightmare, but it more or less did its job.  I've come close to resurrecting it a few times, but it never fully made it back into the light.  Maybe someday.</dd>

<h2>Flash</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>windowbox</dt>
		<dd>So you have two Apple Cinema 30" Displays mounted in the hallway in front of your elevator and you have a bunch of audio, video, and image slideshows that you want to display along with news briefs, upcoming events, weather, and other such useful things.  When I started working at Student Media Interactive, this was the project that I was asked to do.  They had a more or less working first version done in Flash, so Flash was the platform of choice (even though we really should have gone to Director).  I worked on it for a summer and out came windowbox: a dynamic content presentation system written in ActionScript 2.0 that loaded its content from RSS feeds and from local XML files.  It was (and is) a little bit of a nightmare, but I was proud of the accomplishment.</dd>
	<dt><a href="http://www.zoomquilt.org">zoomquilt</a></dt>
		<dd>I came across this innovative collaborative art project and was intrigued with it, but examining the options they had for presentation I found that I wished they had a smoother animation to show how well the artwork interlocks.  I hacked something up in Flash and sent it to the authors.  They liked it and put it on their site, and the Flash animation made it to the front of many popular sites including <a href="http://metafilter.com/">metafilter</a> and <a href="http://www.ebaumsworld.com">ebaumsworld</a> (sometimes incorrectly attributed to my name only).  It looks like the project even has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoomquilt">wikipedia entry</a> now.</dd>
